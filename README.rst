Monorepo Experiment
===================

* `target_packages` would be populated by a script that asks git which files have changed (example_)
* `docs/` would exist for the whole mono repo and not in each subdirectory

.. _example: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-python/blob/master/test_utils/scripts/get_target_packages.py
